**Hackathon Project:**
ErgoMonitor - Enhancing Workplace Health and Productivity
**Project Description:**
ErgoMonitor is an innovative hackathon project designed to promote healthier work habits and environments using the latest sensor technology. Our device, developed using an Arduino Uno, integrates a suite of sensors including an MPU6050 Accelerometer, an Ultrasonic distance sensor (HC-SR04), two photocells, and three colored LEDs, along with essential resistors and jumper wires.

**Key features and benefits**:
1. Posture Monitoring: Utilizing the MPU6050 Accelerometer, our device accurately measures the angle between the neck and the head. This feature helps in detecting poor posture, which is a common cause of neck and back pain among desk workers. By alerting users to correct their posture, we aim to prevent long-term musculoskeletal disorders.

2. Ambient Lighting Assessment: The photocells in our setup assess the ambient lighting of the workspace. Proper lighting is crucial for reducing eye strain and headaches, thereby improving both comfort and focus. Our device ensures that users are working in optimally lit conditions.

3. Screen Distance Measurement: The Ultrasonic distance sensor calculates the distance between the user and the screen. Maintaining an appropriate viewing distance is essential for eye health and can significantly reduce the risk of digital eye strain.

4. Visual Feedback System: Our system employs three LEDs (green, yellow, red) to provide immediate, easy-to-understand feedback based on the data collected. This real-time feedback encourages users to make immediate adjustments to their workspace, fostering healthier work habits.

5. Cost-Effective and DIY Approach: The use of readily available components like Arduino Uno, resistors, and jumper wires makes this project highly accessible and replicable, ideal for a hackathon setting where innovation and practicality are key.

**Impact and Usefulness**:
1. Health Benefits: By addressing key factors such as posture, lighting, and screen distance, ErgoMonitor significantly contributes to the physical well-being of users, potentially reducing health issues associated with sedentary work environments.

2. Productivity Enhancement: A comfortable workspace is synonymous with higher productivity. ErgoMonitor aids in creating an environment that promotes concentration and efficiency.

3. Educational Value: This project serves as an excellent educational tool for those interested in learning about sensor integration and ergonomic solutions.

4. Workplace Application: ErgoMonitor is ideal for both home offices and traditional workspaces, offering a universal solution to common workplace health concerns.

**Conclusion**:
ErgoMonitor stands out as a multifaceted, user-friendly, and impactful project. By combining technology with ergonomic principles, it promises not only to enhance individual health and productivity but also to raise awareness about the importance of a well-designed workspace. This hackathon project is a step towards a healthier, more productive society.
